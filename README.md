# DeepSat6 Airborne Image Classification - Machine Learning Final Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code and final paper for a project to use a convolutional neural network written in PyTorch to perform image classification on the Kaggle DeepSat6 Airborne dataset. This was the final project for the Machine Learning 2 course at George Washington University. It was a group project, however my contribution to the project was writing the code for the neural network, as well as explaining the theory behind the neural network (in the included paper).

## Dataset
The dataset is too large to host on GitHub. To download it, please follow these instructions:
